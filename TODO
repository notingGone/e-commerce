remove all instances of order_items from this project
  it is used once in app/views/cart/checkout.html.erb
  but can be easily replaced

when validation fails qty for line items:
  return error message (flash)

add to quantity instead of adding another line-item
for duplicate product_id

fix redirect_back in cart#clear_cart
          or
redirect to root, with a flash message
